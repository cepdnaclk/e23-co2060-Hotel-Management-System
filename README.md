The Hotel Management System is a centralized web platform designed to optimize the travel experience for tourists in Sri Lanka. Tourists often face difficulties managing room bookings, meal plans, and transport within a limited timeframe. Our solution provides an integrated dashboard where users can seamlessly book hotel stays, discover cultural events, and arrange transport services, all in one place.
